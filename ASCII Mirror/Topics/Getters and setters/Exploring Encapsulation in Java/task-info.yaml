options:
  - text: The &#x27;setName()&#x27; method could have been left out because it&#x27;s
      not standard Java practice.
  - text: The visibility of &#x27;getAge()&#x27; and &#x27;setAge()&#x27; should be
      private.
  - text: The &#x27;setAge()&#x27; method is an example of a setter with validation
      to prevent setting invalid age.
  - text: "We modified the &#x27;age&#x27; field directly without using setter, which\
    \ violates the encapsulation principle."
  - text: The principle of encapsulation is maintained by making the &#x27;name&#x27;
      and &#x27;age&#x27; fields private and accessing them through public methods.
