  - text: The statement `Animal a = new Dog();` is incorrect because the Dog class does
      not explicitly extend the Object class.
  - text: The Dog object cannot be assigned to an Animal reference because Animal class
      doesn&#x27;t implicitly extend the Object class.
  - text: "The Dog object can be assigned to an Animal reference because every class\
    \ in Java implicitly extends the Object class, and it is permitted to assign a\
    \ subclass object to a superclass reference."
  - text: "Even though not explicitly written, both Animal and Dog classes are subclasses\
    \ of the Object class and inherit its methods."
  - text: "The Dog class explicitly states that it extends the Animal class, meaning\
    \ it cannot indirectly be a subclass of the Object class."
