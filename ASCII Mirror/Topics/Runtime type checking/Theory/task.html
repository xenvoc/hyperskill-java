<p>A variable of a base class can always refer to an object of a subclass. We can determine the actual type of the referred object at runtime.</p>
<p>Java provides several ways to do it:</p>
<ul><li><p>the <code class="language-java">instanceof</code> operator that can be used for testing if an object is of a specified type;</p></li><li><p><strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3571" target="_blank" title="In Java, reflection is a powerful feature that allows a programmer to inspect or modify the structure of a class at runtime. | It enables a program to introspect and manipulate its own code, making it a useful tool for runtime code generation, testing, and more. However, it should be used with caution as it can break encapsulation by accessing non-exposed member fields, thereby revealing implementation details. Java reflection is implemented by the `java.lang.reflect` package, which includes several interfaces, classes, and exceptions. The four main classes in this package are `Field`, `Method`, `Constructor`, and `Modifier`. The reflection process involves three steps: first, obtaining the object of the class that you want to reflect on; second, getting the attribute of the class you want to reflect on using methods such as `getFields()`, `getMethods()`, or `getConstructors()`; and third, getting information about the particular attribute you got during the second step using methods such as `getName()`, `getReturnType()`, or `getParameterTypes()`. Reflection can be used to get information about or modify fields, methods, and constructors of a class.">java reflection</a></strong> that can be used to obtain an object representing the class.</p></li></ul>
<p>Let's consider these ways to check types of objects at runtime.</p>
<p>Here is a class hierarchy which we will use in examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Shape {...}

class Circle extends Shape {...}

class Rectangle extends Shape {...}
</code></pre>
<p>The hierarchy is very simple, the fields and methods of classes are hidden for clarity. However, this hierarchy demonstrates the <strong>"IS-A"</strong> relation pretty well.</p>

<p>The <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3571" target="_blank" title="In Java, a binary operator is a type of operator that takes two operands and performs an operation on them. | An example of a binary operator is the XOR operator (^), which compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. It sets the corresponding result bit to 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. Binary operators are used frequently in Java to perform arithmetic and logical operations on variables and values. They are essential for writing complex expressions and performing calculations in Java programs.">binary operator</a> <code class="language-java">instanceof</code> returns <code class="language-java">true</code> if an object is an instance of a particular class or its subclass.</p>
<p>The base syntax is the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">obj instanceof Class</code></pre>
<p>We've created a couple of instances of the classes below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Shape circle = new Circle();  // the reference is Shape, the object is Circle
Shape rect = new Rectangle(); // the reference is Shape, the object is Rectangle</code></pre>
<p>Let's determine their types:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">boolean circleIsCircle = circle instanceof Circle; // true
boolean circleIsRectangle = circle instanceof Rectangle; // false
boolean circleIsShape = circle instanceof Shape; // true

boolean rectIsRectangle = rect instanceof Rectangle; // true
boolean rectIsCircle = rect instanceof Circle; // false
boolean rectIsShape = rect instanceof Shape; // true</code></pre>
<p>So, the <code class="language-java">instanceof</code> operator allows you to determine the actual type of an object even if it is referred to by its superclass.</p>
<p>As you can see, this operator considers a subclass object an instance of the superclass:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">boolean circleIsShape = circle instanceof Shape; // true
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Pay attention,</strong> the type of the object in question should be a subtype (or the type) of the specified class. Otherwise, the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3571" target="_blank" title="In Java, a statement is a unit of code that performs a specific action. | It can be a standalone instruction or a part of a larger block of code. A statement can take various forms, such as assignment statements, object creation statements, method invocation statements, or control flow statements. Control flow statements, such as if-else statements or switch statements, allow for decision-making and conditional execution of code based on certain conditions. A statement's execution order is determined by the program's control flow, which can be affected by blocks, loops, and other control structures.">statement</a> cannot be compiled.</p>
<p>Here is a non-compiled example:</p>

Compile-time errors are typically easier to identify and fix because they prevent the program from compiling, while run-time errors may not be discovered until the program is running.">compile-time error</a>: <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3571" target="_blank" title="In Java, an inconvertible type refers to a situation where the target type is not capable of accommodating all possible values of the source type. | This is often seen in implicit casting, where a value is automatically converted from one data type to another, such as converting a smaller integer type to a larger integer type. However, when attempting to convert a value from a broader type to a narrower type, such as int to byte, explicit casting is required. If the value is too large to be stored in a variable of a particular data type, it can result in a type overflow, causing it to overflow and wrap around to a smaller value.">Inconvertible types</a></strong>.</p>
<h5 id="pattern-matching-for-instanceof">Pattern matching for instanceof</h5>
<p>Since Java 14 we've had language enhancement for the <code class="language-java">instanceof</code> operator as a preview feature, which was then finalized and officially released in Java 16. Before the release of this feature, it could only operate with a type â€” now it is also able to operate with a type pattern. This provides us with a more precise syntax for <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3571" target="_blank" title="In Java, type checking is the process of verifying the compatibility of data types during assignment, operation, or casting. | It can occur at compile-time or runtime. A common example of runtime type checking in Java is the use of the instanceof keyword, which checks if an object is an instance of a specific class or interface. Type checking is crucial in Java to ensure type safety and avoid runtime errors. Java's strong typing system performs type checking at compile-time, which helps catch potential type-related errors before the code is executed. However, in some cases, type checking may also occur at runtime using reflection or pattern matching for instanceof. Type bounds are a way to limit the types that can be used with a generic class or method. By specifying a type bound, you can restrict the type parameter to be a specific class or an extension/implementation of a certain class/interface.">type checking</a>, followed by casting and performing certain operations. To figure out how it's useful to us, let's first look at the code without a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3571" target="_blank" title="In Java, pattern matching is the process of checking if a given string adheres to a specified pattern, known as a regular expression. | Regular expressions are powerful tools for processing strings, as they allow you to define common patterns using regular and special characters. The `matches()` method in Java takes a regular expression pattern as an argument and checks whether the string matches this pattern. It's important to note that `matches()` returns only when the whole string matches the regular expression pattern, not just a substring. This behavior differentiates Java from many other programming languages.">pattern matching</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class PatternMatchingDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object obj = " ";

        if (obj instanceof String) {
            String str = (String) obj;

            if (str.isBlank()) {
                System.out.println("The variable is empty or contains only a whitespace");
            }
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Here we have a very simple application. If the <code class="language-java">obj</code> variable is an instance of the <code class="language-java">String</code> class, we cast it to <code class="language-java">String</code> and perform a certain operation. Now take a look at the code where the new pattern is used:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class PatternMatchingDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object obj = "";

        if (obj instanceof String str) {
            if (str.isBlank()) {
                System.out.println("The variable is empty or contains only a whitespace");
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>If the statement is true, <code class="language-java">obj</code> will be automatically cast to <code class="language-java">String</code> and its value will be assigned to the <code class="language-java">str</code> variable. In addition, we can combine this code with the logical <code class="language-java">&amp;&amp;</code> operator:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class PatternMatchingDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object obj = " ";

        if (obj instanceof String str &amp;&amp; str.length() &gt; 0) {
            if (str.isBlank()) {
                System.out.println("The variable contains only a whitespace");
            }
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The code to the right of the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3571" target="_blank" title="In Java, logical operators are symbols used to combine or negate Boolean expressions. | There are four logical operators in Java: `!` (not), `&amp;&amp;` (and), `` (or), and `^` (xor). The `!` operator negates the Boolean value, while `&amp;&amp;` and `` return true if both, at least one, or exactly one of the operands are true, respectively. The xor operator, `^`, is used less frequently and returns true if the operands have different values. Logical operators are often used to build complex logical expressions that consider multiple factors.">logical operator</a> is executed only if the type checking returns true and the <code class="language-java">obj</code> value is assigned to the <code class="language-java">str</code> pattern variable. That's why the same code using the <code class="language-java">||</code>  logical operator does not compile since it does not require the type checking to return <code class="language-java">true</code>.</p>
<h5 id="use-reflection">Use reflection</h5>
<p>Each object has a method <code class="language-java">getClass</code> that can be used to obtain an object representing the class. We can directly compare the classes represented by objects at runtime using <strong>java reflection</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's consider an example. Here is an instance of <code class="language-java">Circle</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Shape circle = new Circle();</code></pre>
<p>Let's test it using reflection:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">boolean equalsCircle = circle.getClass() == Circle.class; // true
boolean equalsShape = circle.getClass() == Shape.class;   // false
boolean rectangle = circle.getClass() == Rectangle.class; // false</code></pre>
<p>Unlike the <code class="language-java">instanceof</code> operator, this approach performs strict type testing and does not see subclass objects as instances of the superclass.</p>
<p>There is also another way to check types. An object representing the class has a method <code class="language-java">isInstance</code> that is similar to the <code class="language-java">instanceof</code> keyword.</p>
<p>Let's test the object <code class="language-java">circle</code> again.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">boolean isInstanceOfCircle = Circle.class.isInstance(circle); // true
boolean isInstanceOfShape = Shape.class.isInstance(circle); // true
boolean isInstanceOfRectangle = Rectangle.class.isInstance(circle); // false </code></pre>
<p>Similar to the <code class="language-java">instanceof</code> operator, this method considers a subclass object as an instance of its superclass. However, unlike the operator, the following example is successfully compiled:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Circle c = new Circle();
boolean circleIsRect = Rectangle.class.isInstance(c); // false</code></pre>
<p>You can use any of the described approaches to determine the actual type of the referred object.</p>
<h5 id="when-to-use-it">When to use it</h5>
<p>If you cast a superclass object to its subclass, you may get a <code class="language-java">ClassCastException</code> if the object has another type. Before casting, you can check the actual type using one of the approaches we've considered in this topic.</p>
<p>The following example demonstrates it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Shape shape = new Circle();

if (shape.getClass() == Circle.class) {
    Circle circle = (Circle) shape;

    // now we can process it as a circle
}
</code></pre>
