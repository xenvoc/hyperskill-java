<p>The <strong>standard input</strong> is a data stream going into a program and supported by the operating system. By default, the standard input acquires data from keyboard input, but it can be redirected from a file.</p><p>Not every program needs to use the standard input, but you'll use it frequently here to help master your programming skills! The typical approach to solving programming problems is:</p><ol><li><p>Read data from the standard input (System.in);</p></li><li><p>Process data to obtain a result;</p></li><li><p>Output the result to the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/9055" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a standard output is a receiver to which a program can send information in the form of text. | It is supported by all common operating systems and Java provides a special object, `System.out`, to work with the standard output. This object is often used to print data, with the `println()` method displaying the passed string followed by a new line on the screen. Standard output is a way for a program to write data to a destination, which can be a console, a file, or even a web socket. It is important to note that there are two types of streams: byte and character.">standard output</a> (System.out).</p></li></ol><p>This type of code challenge can be easily tested with different input data formats, so we'll use them often.</p><h5 id="reading-data-with-a-scanner">Reading data with a scanner</h5><p>The simplest method to obtain data from the standard input is using the standard class <code class="language-java">Scanner</code>. It allows a program to read values of various types, like strings or numbers, from the standard input. In this topic, we consider reading data from the input.</p><p>To use this class, you should add the following import statement at the top of your file with the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/9055" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a source code is the human-readable text version of a program written in the Java programming language. | It is typically stored in a file with a .java extension and can be edited using a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

The source code can also be decompiled back into readable Java code using a decompiler.">source code</a>.</p><pre><code class="language-java">import java.util.Scanner;</code></pre><p></p><div class="alert alert-primary"><p></p><p>In Java, the <code class="language-java">import</code> <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/9055" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a statement is a unit of code that performs a specific action. | It can be a standalone instruction or a part of a larger block of code.

By importing a class or package, you make it available for use in your code, which enhances readability and maintainability.</p><p></p></div><p>After the import, add a class with this construction:</p><pre><code class="language-java">public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        sc.close();
    }
}</code></pre><p>In the <code class="language-java">main</code> method, we set up the <code class="language-java">Scanner</code> class and telling it to listen for answers from the keyboard (which is represented by <code class="language-java">System.in</code>). So, whenever you want to get input, you're using it to read what someone types in. You'll need this line exactly as it is for now.</p><p>Note that you should close it after use. When you use a <code class="language-java">Scanner</code> in Java, it’s like opening a notebook to take notes or read from it. When you’re done using the notebook, you close it to keep things tidy and make sure it’s properly put away. Closing the <code class="language-java">Scanner</code> with <code class="language-java">scanner.close()</code> is like closing that notebook. It tells your program that you’re finished using the <code class="language-java">Scanner</code>, so it can clean up and release any resources it was using. This helps keep things organized and avoids problems later on.</p><h5 id="reading-string-values">Reading string values</h5><p>The <code class="language-java">Scanner</code> class offers various ways to read inputs. If your input is an integer number or a single word, you can use the <code class="language-java">next()</code> method. For example, the following code snippet reads the user's name and prints a <em>hello</em> message:</p><pre><code class="language-java">public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String name = sc.next();

        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");

        sc.close();
    }
}</code></pre><p>For example, if the user enters their name as James, the program's output will be:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Hello, James!</code></pre><p>If you enter an integer number like 123 as the user's input, the program will output this number. Remember that the <code class="language-java">next()</code> method will store 123 or some other integer number as a string, even if we know that this string represents a number.</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Hello, 123!</code></pre><p>Now, what if a user inputs a compound name like Erich Maria? The program will only output the first word:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Hello, Erich!</code></pre><p>In this case, you'll need to invoke the <code class="language-java">next()</code> method again:</p><pre><code class="language-java">public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String firstName = sc.next(); // "Erich"
        String lastName = sc.next(); // "Maria"

        System.out.println("Hello, " + firstName + " " + lastName  + "!");

        sc.close();
    }
}</code></pre><p>However, it would be more efficient to use another method, the <code class="language-java">nextLine()</code> method, which reads and outputs the entire line:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Hello, Erich Maria!</code></pre><p>You may notice that the <code class="language-java">next()</code> method only reads a single word and excludes any whitespace. On the other hand, the <code class="language-java">nextLine()</code> method includes all space characters it encounters.</p><p>Note that in Java, <strong>whitespace</strong> includes not just the space character, but also everything that appears empty when printed: a tab, the newline character, and other non-printing characters.</p><p>In this article, we'll discuss space and newline characters: essentially, we create a corresponding character when we press Enter and start a new line. The term "whitespace" refers to either of these. A more correct term for what we've been calling a "word" is a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/9055" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a token is a sequence of characters that represents a single unit of meaning in a program. | It is a fundamental element of the language's syntax and is used by the Java compiler to parse and understand the code.

Understanding tokens is crucial for writing valid Java code and for debugging any syntax errors that may occur."><strong>token</strong></a>, which can be described as a piece of text surrounded by whitespace. So we can say that the <code class="language-java">next()</code> method locates and returns the next token, while the <code class="language-java">nextLine()</code> reads all data till the end of the current line.</p><h5 id="reading-other-data-types">Reading other data types</h5><p>In the previous paragraph, you learned how to read string values. Even if you enter a number, both <code class="language-java">next()</code> and <code class="language-java">nextLine()</code> read it as a string. But what if you need to input other types? For this purpose, Java provides us with alternatives of <code class="language-java">next()</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-java">class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        double b = sc.nextDouble();
        boolean c = sc.nextBoolean();

        sc.close();
    }
}</code></pre><p>Each of these works similarly to <code class="language-java">next()</code>, but instead of reading the input as a string, they scan the input as their corresponding <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/9055" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a data type is a category that determines the type of data a variable can hold and the operations that can be performed on it. | Java has two groups of data types: primitive and reference types. Primitive data types are built-in and include eight types, such as int (integer number), float and double (fractional numbers), and boolean (true or false values). Reference types, on the other hand, are used to represent objects, and they are created using the keyword new. When a reference type is created, memory is allocated for the object, and it is called instantiation. Floating-point types, such as float and double, represent numbers that contain an integer part, a fractional part, and their separator, commonly used in fields such as science, statistics, and engineering.">data types</a>. So, while <code class="language-java">next()</code> always returns a string, these methods directly give you the specific type of value you need, making it easier to work with numerical and boolean data.</p><h5 id="reading-a-multiline-input">Reading a multiline input</h5><p>Reading multiline input might be a bit complicated; you need to consider the cursor's position and the behavior of the reading methods.</p><p>Let's explore this with an example:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">|This is a simple

multiline input,

</code></pre><p><strong>|</strong> indicates the cursor's position before reading the input.</p><p>If we call the <code class="language-java">next()</code> method, the program will read the input up to the whitespace:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">This| is a simple

multiline input,

that is being read
</code></pre><p>After invoking the <code class="language-java">nextLine()</code> method, the program reads the remaining line starting from the whitespace. If there is such a line in your input, the <code class="language-java">nextLine()</code> places the cursor at the start of the new line:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">This is a simple

|multiline input,

that is being read
</code></pre><p>Next, let's invoke the <code class="language-java">next()</code> method two times. The first input is indicated by the position of the cursor which is right after the word and before the whitespace:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">This is a simple

multiline| input,

that is being read
</code></pre><p>We're now invoking the <code class="language-java">next()</code> method once again. The program outputs the second word in the line <em>without</em> any whitespace. The number of space characters doesn't matter, as the <code class="language-java">next()</code> method will skip the whitespace until it finds the next token.</p><p>As you'll see, the cursor's position remains at the current line, just before the new line and after the comma:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">This is a simple

multiline input,|

that is being read
</code></pre><p>Here's a tricky thing about the <code class="language-java">nextLine()</code> method, which also shows a major difference between <code class="language-java">next()</code> and <code class="language-java">nextLine()</code> methods. As you know already, the program will read input from the cursor's position to the new line (again, if such a line exists in your input). In this example, the cursor is placed before the new line. This means the <code class="language-java">nextLine()</code> method will return an empty line ("") and place the cursor at the start of a new line.</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">This is a simple

multiline input,

|that is being read</code></pre><p>To sum it all up, let's look at the entire code and consider what variables we've just read:</p><pre><code class="language-java">import java.util.Scanner; 

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);  

        String word1 = sc.next(); // "This"
        String line1 = sc.nextLine(); // " is a simple" 
        String word2 = sc.next(); // "multiline"
        String word3 = sc.next(); // "input,"
        String line2 = sc.nextLine(); // "" 

        sc.close();
    }
}</code></pre><p>This example may seem a bit artificial, but it should assist you in understanding the difference between these two methods—remember that usually, variables have more expressive names.</p><h5 id="character-encoding-in-scanner">Character Encoding in Scanner</h5><p>Starting with Java 18, the default character encoding used by <code class="language-java">Scanner</code> and other Java APIs is <code class="language-java">UTF-8</code>.</p><p>Previously, Java relied on the platform’s default charset, which varied depending on the system locale and operating system (e.g., Windows might use <code class="language-java">Cp1252</code>, Linux might use <code class="language-java">UTF-8</code>, etc.).</p><p>This inconsistency often led to subtle bugs, especially when handling special characters, accented letters, or non-Latin alphabets.</p><p>From Java 18 onwards, you can safely assume that input/output operations that rely on the default charset will use <code class="language-java">UTF-8</code> — which is consistent, predictable, and supports all characters in the Unicode standard.</p><p>If you're reading input via Scanner, especially from redirected files or when working with multilingual input, <code class="language-java">UTF-8</code> ensures that characters like <code class="language-java">é</code>, <code class="language-java">ö</code>, or <code class="language-java">你好</code> are read and interpreted correctly across all platforms.</p><p>Keep in mind that programs running on older Java versions (before 18) might behave differently depending on the environment.</p><h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5><p>You can read data from the standard input with a specialized <code class="language-java">Scanner</code> class. The <code class="language-java">next()</code> and <code class="language-java">nextLine()</code> methods help you read strings. Both are used for gathering input, but they act differently. The <code class="language-java">next()</code> method reads input until the next whitespace, while the <code class="language-java">nextLine()</code> method reads input to the end of the line.</p><p>We suggest using the <code class="language-java">Scanner</code> class when solving programming challenges—it is one of the simplest ways to obtain values from the standard input.</p>
