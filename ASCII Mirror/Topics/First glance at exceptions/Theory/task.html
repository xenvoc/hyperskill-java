<p>Some errors in your code do not prevent the program from running and, in this case, the program will only crash while trying to execute a "broken" line: a line with an error called an <strong>exception</strong>. Thus, exceptions are the errors detected during the program <strong>execution</strong> (at runtime), whereas <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3497" target="_blank" title="In Java, a syntax error is a type of compile-time error that prevents a Java program from being compiled due to incorrect syntax. | These errors can include typos in keywords, missing symbols at the end of a statement, incorrect naming of methods, and invoking non-existing methods, among others. Syntax errors are different from exceptions, which are errors detected during program execution. To avoid syntax errors, programmers can use a modern Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with a static code analyzer.">syntax errors</a> are those detected during <strong>compiling</strong> the program into byte-code. An exception interrupts the normal execution of a program.</p>
<p>Let's consider two types of exceptions and how to avoid them.</p>
<h5 id="arithmeticexception">ArithmeticException</h5>
<p>Suppose you are writing a program that reads two integers from the standard input and then outputs the result of the integer division of the first number by the second one. Take a look at the code below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">import java.util.Scanner;

public class ArithmeticExceptionDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.println(a / b); // an exception is possible here!
        System.out.println("finished");
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>If the user passes <code class="language-java">9</code> and <code class="language-java">3</code> as the input values, the program outputs <code class="language-java">3</code> as well as the <code class="language-java">"finished"</code> string. But if the second number is <code class="language-java">0</code>, the program throws an exception because of the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3497" target="_blank" title="In Java, a division by zero occurs when a program attempts to divide a number by zero. | This results in an ArithmeticException, which terminates the program and provides the developer with information about the error, such as the file name and line number where it occurred. To prevent this, a program can check the value before division and print a message if the value is zero. This is more user-friendly than the standard error message and ensures that the program always finishes successfully.">division by zero</a>, and the <code class="language-java">"finished"</code> string is not printed at all.</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
  at ArithmeticExceptionDemo.main(ArithmeticExceptionDemo.java:11)</code></pre>
<p>All the code <strong>before</strong> the exception is executed properly, and everything <strong>after </strong>is not.</p>
<p>The displayed message shows the cause of the exception (<code class="language-java">"/ by zero"</code>), the file and the line number where it has occurred (<code class="language-java">ArithmeticExceptionDemo.java:11</code>). The provided information is useful for developers, but it is not very meaningful for the end-users of the program.</p>
<p>To avoid the exception, we can check the value before the division, and, if the value is zero, print a message. Here is another version of the program: If the second number is zero, the program will print the "<strong>Division by zero!</strong>" string.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">import java.util.Scanner;

public class ArithmeticExceptionDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        int a = scanner.nextInt();
        int b = scanner.nextInt();

        if (b == 0) {
            System.out.println("Division by zero!");
        } else {
            System.out.println(a / b);
        }
        System.out.println("finished");
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Look at an input example. Let's try to input zero as a divider:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">3 0</code></pre>
<p>The result is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Division by zero!
finished</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the new version of the program does not throw an exception and always successfully finishes. Additionally, it prints a user-friendly message instead of the standard message.</p>
<h5 id="numberformatexception">NumberFormatException</h5>
<p>Another situation to consider is when you are trying to convert a string into an integer number: If the string has an unsuitable format, the code will throw an exception.</p>
<p>The following program reads a line from the standard input and then outputs the number that follows it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">import java.util.Scanner;

public class NumberFormatExceptionDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = scanner.nextLine();

        int number = Integer.parseInt(input); // an exception is possible here!
        System.out.println(number + 1);
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>It works pretty well if the input line is a correct integer number, but if the input is not correct (e.g. <code class="language-java">"121a"</code>), the program will fail:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "121a"
  at java.base/java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(NumberFormatException.java:65)
  at java.base/java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:652)
  at java.base/java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:770)
  at NumberFormatExceptionDemo.main(NumberFormatExceptionDemo.java:9)</code></pre>
<p>This message displays the type of exception (<code class="language-java">NumberFormatException</code>) and the passed input string. The place where the exception occurred is shown in the last line of the message:</p>
<ul><li><p>the filename is <code class="language-java">NumberFormatExceptionDemo.java</code>;</p></li><li><p>the <code class="language-java">main</code> method;</p></li><li><p>the line 9.</p></li></ul>
<p>All the previous lines of the message show the positions inside the <code class="language-java">parseInt</code> method that is part of the standard library.</p>
<p>To avoid this exception, it is possible to check the input string by using a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3497" target="_blank" title="In Java, a regular expression (regex) is a sequence of characters that specifies a set of strings and is used to search, edit, and manipulate text. | Java has built-in support for regular expressions, with the String class having a special method called matches() that takes a regular expression pattern as an argument and checks whether the string matches this pattern. Regular expressions are a powerful tool for processing strings in Java, as they allow you to define common patterns using regular characters and special characters, and then check whether strings match these patterns.">regular expression</a>. In case the input is not correct, we can output a warning message:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">import java.util.Scanner;

public class NumberFormatExceptionDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = scanner.nextLine();

        if (input.matches("\\d+")) { // it checks if the input line contains only digits
            int number = Integer.parseInt(input);
            System.out.println(number + 1);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Incorrect number: " + input);
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>If the input line is "121a", the program will not stop, and it will print the message:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Incorrect number: 121a</code></pre>
<p> </p>
