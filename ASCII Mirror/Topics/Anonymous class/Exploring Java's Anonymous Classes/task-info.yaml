    \ is invoked on si due to the anonymous class&#x27;s access to final variables\
    \ in its enclosing scope."
  - text: "The return type of method() doesn&#x27;t match the data type of x, hence\
    \ this will cause a compile-time error."
  - text: The code will not compile because anonymous classes canâ€™t access variables
      from the enclosing scope.
  - text: The anonymous class is behaving as a concrete implementation of the SomeInterface
