<p>All objects in a class share the same fields and methods, even though the values of object fields usually differ. A class can also possess fields and methods that are common to all objects.

For example, the declaration of a method may include its name, return type, access modifier, and parameter list. Declarations are essential for Java to understand the structure and behavior of the program. Incorrect declarations can lead to compilation errors. In the context of variables, a declaration specifies the type, name, and initial value of a variable. The type of a variable determines what possible operations can be performed on the variable and which value can be stored in it. Every variable has a name (also known as an identifier) to distinguish it from others. Before using a variable, it must be declared. The general form of a variable declaration is: `type identifier = value;`

Reference types can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to methods, and returned as values from methods. They are important for creating complex, object-oriented programs in Java. Unlike primitive types, which store their values directly, reference types store a reference to an object. When comparing reference types using the == operator, it compares the references (memory addresses) rather than the actual values. Additionally, assigning one value of a reference variable to another creates a copy of the reference, rather than the value itself. Reference types can also refer to a special value that represents the fact that it is not initialized yet or does not have a value.

A static field has the same value for all instances of the class. it belongs to the class, rather than to an instance of the class.</p>
<p>If you want all instances of a class to share a common value, like a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/3534" target="_blank" title="In Java, a global variable is also known as a class variable or a static variable. | It is declared in a class, typically written in uppercase letters with words separated by underscores, and is associated with the class itself rather than with individual instances of the class.

This approach can help save memory as all the created objects share a single copy of a static variable.</p>
<p>You can directly access static variables by the class name. To access a static field, you should write:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">ClassName.fieldName;</code></pre>
<p>Now let's take a look at an example. Here is a class with two public static variables:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class SomeClass {

    public static String staticStringField;

    public static int staticIntField;
}</code></pre>
<p>We can set their values and retrieve them:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">SomeClass.staticIntField = 10;
SomeClass.staticStringField = "it's a static member";

System.out.println(SomeClass.staticIntField); // It prints "10"
System.out.println(SomeClass.staticStringField); // It prints "it's a static member"</code></pre>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>You can also access the value of a static field through an instance of the class.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">SomeClass.staticIntField = 30;

SomeClass instance = new SomeClass();

System.out.println(instance.staticIntField); // It prints "30"</code></pre>
<p>Now let's dive into a more complex example. This class has a static field named <code class="language-java">lastCreated</code>. The field records the date of the last created instance.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class SomeClass {

    public static Date lastCreated;

    public SomeClass() {
        lastCreated = new Date();
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Every time a new object is created, the value of the static field changes in the class constructor.</p>
<p>The following code creates two instances and prints intermediate results:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">System.out.println(SomeClass.lastCreated);

SomeClass instance1 = new SomeClass();
System.out.println(SomeClass.lastCreated);

They are often public, but it's not a requirement.">class constants</a></strong>, which means they cannot be changed. According to the naming convention, constant fields should always be written in uppercase with an underscore (<code class="language-java">_</code>) to separate parts of the name.</p>
<p>The standard class <code class="language-java">Math</code> , for example, contains two static constants:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static final double E = 2.7182818284590452354;

public static final double PI = 3.14159265358979323846;</code></pre>
<p>Constants are often public, but it's not a rule.</p>
<p> To see how they work, let's declare a class named <code class="language-java">Physics</code> with two static constants:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Physics {

    /**
     * The speed of light in a vacuum (m/s)
     */

    /**
     * Electron mass (kg)
     */
    public static final double ELECTRON_MASS = 9.1093837e-31;
}</code></pre>
<p>To use the constants, let's write the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">System.out.println(Physics.ELECTRON_MASS); // 9.1093837E-31
System.out.println(Physics.SPEED_OF_LIGHT); // 299792458</code></pre>
<p>Since those fields are constants, we cannot change their values. If we try to do it, we'll get an error:</p>

<p>The Java class library provides a lot of static methods for different classes. Here are just a few of them:</p>

<p>Here is a class with one constructor, a static method and an instance method.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class SomeClass {
    
    public SomeClass() {
        invokeAnInstanceMethod(); // this is possible here
        invokeAStaticMethod();    // this is possible here too
    }
    
    public static void invokeAStaticMethod() { 
        // it's impossible to invoke invokeAnInstanceMethod() here
    }

<p>This example shows that you can invoke a static method from the instance context (constructors and instance methods), but you can't invoke an instance method from a static context.</p>
<p>The only way to call an instance method from a static one is to provide a reference to this instance as an argument. You can also create objects of other classes and call their methods in a similar way. Here's an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static void invokeAStaticMethod(SomeClass someClassInstance) {

    // calling instance method from static context by passing instance as an argument
    someClassInstance.invokeAnInstanceMethod(); 

    // calling instance and static methods of AnotherClass instance
    AnotherClass anotherClassInstance = new AnotherClass();
    anotherClassInstance.invokeAnotherClassInstanceMethod();
    anotherClassInstance.invokeAnotherClassStaticMethod();
}</code></pre>
<p>An example of a static method is the <code class="language-java">main</code> method. It should always be static.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>In this topic, we discussed static fields and methods and some situations where we can use them. It is important to remember that static members cannot access the values of object fields since there is no instance context (<code class="language-java">this</code>). Nonetheless, they are a good option for providing a set of common constants (together with <code class="language-java">final</code>) and utility methods for the whole project. We will consider other helpful ways of using static members in the next topics.</p>
