<div class="step-text">
<p>Consider the following snippet of Java code: </p><pre><code class="language-java">public class Animal {} 
public class Dog extends Animal {} 
public class Main { 
public static void main(String[] args) { 
Animal a = new Dog(); 
} 
}</code></pre> In this scenario, what are the correct statements considering the relationship between the classes and the objects created, and what role the Java Object class plays?
