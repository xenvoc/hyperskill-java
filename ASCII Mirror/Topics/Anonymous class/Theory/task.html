<p>Sometimes developers need to use a small class that overrides some methods of another class or interface only <strong>once</strong>. In this case, <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/11896" target="_blank" title="In Java, a declaration is a statement that introduces a variable, method, or class into the program. | It specifies the type of the entity being declared, its name, and other relevant information such as access modifier, return type (for method), and initial value (for variable). For example, the declaration of a method may include its name, return type, access modifier, and parameter list. Declarations are essential for Java to understand the structure and behavior of the program. Incorrect declarations can lead to compilation errors. In the context of variables, a declaration specifies the type, name, and initial value of a variable. The type of a variable determines what possible operations can be performed on the variable and which value can be stored in it. Every variable has a name (also known as an identifier) to distinguish it from others. Before using a variable, it must be declared. The general form of a variable declaration is: `type identifier = value;`

It's important to note that a declaration is not the same as an assignment.">declaring</a> a new class may be superfluous. Fortunately, Java provides a mechanism for creating a class in a single <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/11896" target="_blank" title="In Java, a statement is a unit of code that performs a specific action. | It can be a standalone instruction or a part of a larger block of code. A statement can take various forms, such as assignment statements, object creation statements, method invocation statements, or control flow statements. Control flow statements, such as if-else statements or switch statements, allow for decision-making and conditional execution of code based on certain conditions. A statement's execution order is determined by the program's control flow, which can be affected by blocks, loops, and other control structures.">statement</a> without having to declare a new named class.

<p><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/11896" target="_blank" title="In Java, an anonymous class is a small class that implements an interface or extends another class (concrete or abstract) and is declared and instantiated at the same time, without the need to declare a new named class. | It is called anonymous because it doesn't have a name identifier. Anonymous class enables you to declare and instantiate a class in a single statement, which is useful when you need to use a class that overrides some methods of another class or interface only once.

Instantiated objects have their own identity and state, allowing them to interact with other objects and methods in the program. It's important to note that instantiation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming, as it enables the creation of multiple instances of a class, each with its own unique characteristics and behavior.">instantiate</a> a class at the same time.</p>
<p>An anonymous class always implements an interface or extends another class (concrete or abstract). Here is the common syntax of creating an anonymous class:</p>

A lambda expression, specifically, is an anonymous function that can be assigned to a variable. Its general form consists of a list of parameters followed by the body of the function. The body can return a value. Lambda expressions are particularly useful when you want to pass a small function as a parameter to a method, or when you want to create a function on the fly, without having to define a separate method for it. Unlike a switch statement, which can update the value of a predefined variable, a switch expression evaluates to a specific value and is assigned to a variable.">expression</a>.

<div class="alert alert-warning">An anonymous class must override all abstract methods of the superclass. That is, all interface methods must be overridden except default methods. If an anonymous class extends a class that has no abstract methods, it doesn't have to override anything.</div>

<h5 id="writing-anonymous-classes" style="text-align: center;">Writing anonymous classes</h5>
<p>Let's assume we have the following interface with two methods:</p>
<pre><code class="java">interface SpeakingEntity {

    void sayHello();

    void sayBye();
}</code></pre>
<p>Here is an anonymous class that represents an English-speaking person:</p>
<pre><code class="java">SpeakingEntity englishSpeakingPerson = new SpeakingEntity() {
            
    @Override
    public void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("Hello!");
    }

    @Override
    public void sayBye() {
        System.out.println("Bye!");
    }
};</code></pre>
<p>The anonymous class is declared and instantiated at the same time â€” as an expression. It overrides both methods of the interface.</p>
<p>We assign an instance of the <strong>anonymous class</strong> to the variable of the interface type. Now, we can invoke overridden methods:</p>
<pre><code class="java">englishSpeakingPerson.sayHello();
englishSpeakingPerson.sayBye();</code></pre>
<p>Of course, the result is</p>
<pre><code class="java">Hello!
Bye!</code></pre>
<p>Let's declare and instantiate another anonymous class:</p>
<pre><code class="java">SpeakingEntity cat = new SpeakingEntity() {

    @Override
    public void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("Meow!");
    }

    @Override
    public void sayBye() {
        System.out.println("Meow!");
    }
};</code></pre>
<p>When we invoke the same methods, we obtain the following result:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Meow!
Meow!</code></pre>
<p>So, <code class="java">englishSpeakingPerson</code> and <code class="java">cat</code> are instances of different anonymous classes that implement the same interface.</p>
<h5 id="accessing-context-variables" style="text-align: center;">Accessing context variables</h5>
<p>In the body of an anonymous class, it is possible to capture variables from a context where it is defined:</p>
<ul>
<li>an anonymous class can capture members of its enclosing class (the outer class);</li>
<li>an anonymous class can capture local variables that are declared as <code class="java">final</code> or are <strong>effectively final</strong> (i.e. the variable is not changed but it doesn't have the <code class="java">final</code> keyword).</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is another anonymous class that implements the <code class="java">SpeakingEntity</code> interface:</p>
<pre><code class="java">public class AnonymousClassExample {

    private static String BYE_STRING = "Auf Wiedersehen!"; // static constant

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        final String hello = "Guten Tag!"; // final local variable

        SpeakingEntity germanSpeakingPerson = new SpeakingEntity() {

            @Override
            public void sayHello() {
                System.out.println(hello); // it captures the local variable
            }

            @Override
            public void sayBye() {
                System.out.println(BYE_STRING); // it captures the constant field
            }
        };

        germanSpeakingPerson.sayHello();

        germanSpeakingPerson.sayBye();
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The anonymous class captures the constant field <code class="java">BYE_STRING</code> and the local <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/11896" target="_blank" title="In Java, a final variable is a variable that is declared with the final keyword and cannot be modified once it has been initialized. | Final variables can be of any data type, including primitive types and reference types. They are typically used for values that should remain constant throughout the execution of a program. Once a final variable is assigned a value, it cannot be reassigned. However, if the final variable is a reference type, the state of the object it references can still be modified, as long as the reference itself remains unchanged. If a final variable is not initialized at the time of declaration, it must be assigned a value in a constructor of the class.">final variable</a> <code class="java">hello</code>. This code is successfully compiled and prints what we expect:</p>

<h5 id="when-to-use-anonymous-classes" style="text-align: center;">When to use anonymous classes</h5>
<p>Generally, you should consider using an anonymous class when:</p>
<ul>
<li>only one instance of the class is needed</li>
<li>the class has a very short body</li>
<li>the class is used right after it's defined</li>
</ul>
<p>In this topic, we've considered rather simple anonymous classes to understand the basic syntax, but in real-life applications, they provide a powerful mechanism for creating classes that encapsulate behaviors and pass them to suitable methods. This is a convenient way to interact with parts of our application or with some third-party libraries.</p>
<p>And in the next topic about anonymous classes you will become acquainted with more difficult examples and will dive into the intricacies of anonymous classes. See you soon!</p>
